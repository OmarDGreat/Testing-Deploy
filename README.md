# Portfolio-Using-React

# Description
This protfolio was created using React. The aim of this project is to develop a portfolio site that displays information about myself and demonstrates projects I have previously created to show potential employers my skills in the web development industry. It also enables potential employers to get in contact with me through various methods. 

# Installation
Run npm run dev. Ensure you have installed the base dependencies by running npm install as well as running npm install axios react-router-dom bootstrap. 

# Usage
This project has a navbar at the top of the page which links to three different pages. The first page is the home page which details information about myself. The second page is a projects page which has a list of 6 projects I have completed. When a project title is clicked a card will display on the side with the project name, a description of the software used, links to the github and deployed site as well as a screenshot of the application. The final page will display a contact form and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profile.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://embow24.github.io/Portfolio-Using-React/
